ABOUT

  This is a work-in-progress (but highly recommended) nginx.conf configuration
  file for use together with Qlik Sense. It can be used as a starting point to
  pick from or as is. Some features are in there to be enabled by choice.

  The aim is to provide a simple but secure, fast and flexible configuration
  with options to suit most use cases. If you have any specific requirements
  or wishes, let me know and I'll see what I can do!

REQUIREMENTS

  - Qlik Sense requires websocket support which was introduced in nginx 1.3.1.
